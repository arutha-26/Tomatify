# Tomatify
This project is our final project for Bangkit Academy 2023.

**Backgrounder:**

Tomato farmers generally use traditional methods by looking at the leaves to determine the disease in tomato plants. These problems can lead to misdiagnosis and treatment used due to limited information about plant diseases. In addition, it can cause a decrease in tomato plant productivity. From this problem the question arises, how to detect diseases in tomato plants? Therefore, our team is developing a mobile application that utilizes cloud computing and machine learning to provide early detection of diseases in tomato plants. With the increasing demand for sustainable agriculture, it is crucial to address the challenges of plant disease management. Our app will offer an efficient solution to this problem by allowing farmers to detect diseases in their tomato plants at an early stage.

**Android:** 

Application of Machine learning models through endpoints that have been provided by the cloud computing team and application development for users. Program development starts with UI/UX. The application has authentication in the form of email verification in registering a new account. has the latest news features obtained from trusted sources regarding agriculture.


**Classification Desease Detection:**

- [x] Healthy
- [x] Bacterial Spot
- [x] Early Blight
- [x] Late Blight
- [x] Leaf Mold
- [x] Mosaic Virus
- [x] Septoria Leaf Spot
- [x] Spider Mites
- [x] Target Spot
